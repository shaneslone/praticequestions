#Challenge Questions For QA & DEV

This program presents challenge questions for SDETs & SDEs in order to help 
prepare for future interviews. The questions have been split into two packages one for 
SDETs and one for SDEs. Most of the challenge questions given 
can be checked for correctness by running the Main method. Other questions however are opened ended,
requiring a written/spoken verbal response or challenge a user to implement their own testing 
in terms of proving the validity of their work.

Where available links have been provided for the Leetcode versions of the problems
